# Surge Mac 6

It has been more than two years since the release of Surge Mac 5. During these two years, we have delivered many significant free updates, such as:

* New Network Extension takeover mode
* Smart Group
* New proxy protocol support (SS2022/Hysteria2/TUIC)
* Pre-matching rules
* Manipulating JSON Body with JQ expressions
* Port forwarding
* Proxy port hopping
* Script panel
* Giant rule set support
* Protocol sniffing
* Surge Ponte sharing
* Device icon library

We counted—a total of 11 major versions, 43 minor versions, and over 1000 beta builds have been released in the past two years.

As we have previously explained, under the model of paid major version updates, developers should ideally “stockpile” features and release them all in the next major version, as this is the most optimal policy. However, we really didn’t want to do this; we didn’t want to intentionally delay the implementation of new features. So, even during the free update cycle, Surge has maintained a high-intensity, unreserved update pace.

But this has indeed caused us some troubles. When it’s time for a major version update, users might feel that the new features are not sufficient to justify a paid update, unless we deliberately delay the release of new features.

This is a common problem faced by almost all active developers. As a result, a large number of software nowadays have switched to pure subscription or maintenance update subscription models (such as TablePlus, ForkLift, Sketch, Tower, Kaleidoscope, etc.). Therefore, Surge will also shift to a maintenance subscription model.

Details are as follows:

1. The price of Surge Mac 6 remains the same. After purchase, you will have a one-year maintenance subscription, allowing free updates within a year.
2. After the subscription expires, you may continue to use the last version forever. To receive updates, you need to renew the maintenance subscription.
3. Maintenance subscription prices are:

| Number of Licensed Devices | Maintenance Subscription Renewal (12 months) |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1 device                   | US $19.99                                    |
| 3 devices                  | US $29.99                                    |
| 5 devices                  | US $45.99                                    |

4. Users who have already purchased Surge Mac 5 will also receive a one-year maintenance subscription from the date of purchase. In other words, users who purchase Surge Mac 5 after July 1, 2024, will be able to update to Surge Mac 6.0 for free. For older users who purchased Surge Mac 5 before this, just renew the subscription to upgrade to v6.
5. There will no longer be any paid major version updates.
6. Surge Mac 3/4 users still need to pay a one-time upgrade fee to v6, which will also come with a one-year subscription from the date of the upgrade.

Just like the iOS version, you only need to subscribe and update when you feel there is a need. **Subscription is completely optional; even if you don’t subscribe, you can always use your existing version of Surge Mac.**

### Surge Mac 6.0 New Features

In Surge Mac 6.0, we have once again brought many creative and unique new features, as well as a brand new design. Due to the large number of features, please refer to [Surge Mac 6.0 Release](https://kb.nssurge.com/surge-knowledge-base/release-notes/surge-mac-6-release-note) for more information.

### Trial

If you wish to try before renewing, go to More › License panel in Surge Mac, deactivate your current license, then restart Surge and select “Start Trial” to enjoy a free seven-day trial of Surge Mac 6.

Even if you have previously used the seven-day free trial, you can try version 6.0 again. In addition, from now on, you can start another seven-day free trial every year once one year has passed since the end of your last trial. This allows you to experience new subscription update versions for free every year.

After the trial expires, if you wish to roll back to the old version, simply activate your license. Surge will automatically download and replace it with the old version. (If you have made incompatible profile changes, please remember to adjust your settings back to those of the old version.)

### Other Details

* If you previously upgraded the number of licenses during the Surge Mac 5 era, the purchase date of your subscription will be weighted based on the payment amount, and the maintenance subscription period will be calculated accordingly.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if you purchased a 1-device license on 2021/7/27 and upgraded to a 3-device license on 2022/8/23, your equivalent purchase date would be 2021/12/20.
{% endhint %}

* From now on, when upgrading the number of authorized devices, the upgrade fee will no longer differ from directly purchasing the license pack. After upgrading, the new subscription period will be one year, and the original devices need to be filled up to the same expiration date.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if you currently have a 1-device license, with 200 days left on the subscription, upgrading to a 3-device license will cost: $69.99 - $49.99 + $29.99 / 3 \* (1 − 200 / 365) = $24.5, which includes the price difference of $20 and an additional 165 days’ subscription fee of $4.5 for the already owned device. After the upgrade, the entire license’s validity period will be 365 days.

Since the original devices are renewed at the higher-tier discounted subscription price, buying an upgrade pack directly is more cost-effective than renewing first and then upgrading the number of devices.
{% endhint %}

* To protect the rights of long-term users, the unlock time for the first version of Surge Mac 6.0 is fixed at July 1, 2025. Even if the actual release date of 6.0 is after your subscription expires, as long as your subscription is active after July 1, 2025, you will be able to use it. Future versions will use their respective release dates as reference.

### FAQ

* Do I have to upgrade to the latest version during the subscription period to continue using the last version forever?

No. Even if the subscription has expired, you can always update to the latest version released before expiration.

* How can I know about new features?

We now provide a web version of the release notes, updated in sync with the update system: <https://nssurge.com/support/mac/release-notes>. You can check all version updates and release dates here.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a new version is available, if your subscription has expired, you’ll receive a subtle notification in the main interface’s event list. You can click to view it. If you do not want to receive this message, you may click and choose to pause notifications for a set time or permanently disable them.
