Policy
======

Surge can forward requests to another proxy server or connect to the host directly, depending on customized rules. A policy indicates how Surge will deal with the requests.

There are 3 types of policies: [proxy](https://manual.nssurge.com/policy/proxy.html), [policy group](https://manual.nssurge.com/policy/group.md) and [built-in policy](https://manual.nssurge.com/policy/built-in.html).
